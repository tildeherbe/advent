advent of code

i'm doing advent of code and throwing everything in here

welcome to what is not only my first go of Actually Learning Programming in Any Meaningful Way (i.e. not just print("et cetera"))
but also my first go of managing my own GitHub repo

terribly unorganized for the moment but everything's functional for now (functional in the strictest sense of the word, in that somehow d1.py got me the 2 stars lmaooooo)

anyway yeah the whole goal is to learn how to code through this, i'm using python

using this to:

learn to break problems down into tiny steps

get better at searching online for info and guidance

learn about python and get a feel for the language

get a feel for what programming even is in general honestly 

have fun with friends :) and use what they put together to help me understand the problems and possible solutions in greater depth
